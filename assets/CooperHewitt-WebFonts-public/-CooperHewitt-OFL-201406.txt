PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open t License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development of collaborative t projects, to support the t creation efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which ts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

The OFL allows the licensed ts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The ts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works. The ts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The requirement for ts to remain under this license does not apply to any document created using the ts or their derivatives.
